# Sign Language Detector
A sign language detector in python made using OpenCV, MediaPipe, Pickle, Numpy and Scikit-Learn.
Train your dataset locally by providing it with the sign language image data. Scikit learn does the classification work using RandomForestClassifier. Run classify.py after training it enough and you will be able to see the text the model is inferring.
